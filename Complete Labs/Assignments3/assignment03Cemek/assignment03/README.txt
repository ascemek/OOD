The source code directory contains the following files:
DemoSorting.java - This class implements bubbleSort, insertionSort, selectionSort, mergeSort and test them for
different n-random numbers for the array. Run to see the times of the sorting algorithms.

RandomNumberGenerator.java - generateRandomNumbers(int n) method generates an array of n random Integers.

XChartDemo.java - This file creates graphs for each sorting algorithm separately. Look at the JPG files to see the
graphs produced.(bubbleSortOutput.jpg, insertionSortOutput.jpg, mergeSortOutput.jpg, selectionSortOutput.jpg)
 
XChartDemo.java - This file creates graphs for each sorting algorithm on a one graph. Look at the JPG file to see 
the graph produced.(AllSortingAlgorithms.jpg)

Instructions:
Place all the files in a project and run them to see different outputs mentioned above.
Or
$ javac *.java
