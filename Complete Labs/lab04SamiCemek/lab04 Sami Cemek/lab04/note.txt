Scene 2:
(10 points) To Do:
What challenges do the testing team face initially? Write your answers in `note.txt` file.
Write necessary code to test both classes (`USRobotProducer`, `ChineseRobotIndustry`).

The testing team initially will face problems with how to instantitate robot object.
USRobotProducer and ChineseRobotIndustry are doing something similar and has a parent class Robot 
but method names are different. "deliver" and "build" purpose is the same. "test" and "testYourRobot"
purpose is the same. Testing team need to write a different test cases for different robots.
Method names and signratures are different even though their purpose is the same.
